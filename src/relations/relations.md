# Relations

In this chapter, we will explore what solutions comes with `Canyon` when talking
about `SQL` relations, how we can create or destroy them, and how we can query
data in a specific way through the relation.

Relations in `Canyon` needs the `full` mode to be enabled in order to work, so review
the past [chapter](..the_final_boss.md) if you still are in doubts.
