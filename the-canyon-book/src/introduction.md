Welcome to `The Canyon's SQL book`! This is a *work-in-progress* user guide for the `Canyon-SQL` ORM and querybuilder.

# Phylosophy of design
You can check out the core guidelines behind the `Canyon-SQL` framework [in this chapter](https://zerodaycode.github.io/canyon-book/canyon_design.html)

# The Rust programming language
If you're new to the `Rust` programming language, before getting started, it is highly recommended that you familiarize yourself with all of the concepts 
outlined in the officially maintained Rust Book before you getting started with `Canyon-SQL`.

# Contributing to Canyon's source code or to the book documentation

We are really glad to met new developers that push up this project to a new level.
but, in order to maintain a certain order and consistency during development, 
assuming you want to add new functionality, modify or improve some part of the source code, or fix a bug,
we would like any contributor to respect the following guidelines:

    1 - Open an issue [here](https://github.com/zerodaycode/Canyon-SQL/issues) explaining what do you want to change or upgrade on the source code
    2 - Locally clone the repo and work in the source code
    3 - Open a `PR` to a new branch, and try to documentate as much as posible the changes made it in the commits to your working branch.

So, if you want to *contribute* to the source code:
    - `Canyon-SQL` it's a fully open-source project. You cand find it [here](https://github.com/zerodaycode/Canyon-SQL)

If you go ahead, and want to upgrade the documentation with things that you miss that must be explained, or with some changes
that has been accepted on a `PR`, and you want to document it:
    - The source code for this book is [this one](https://github.com/zerodaycode/canyon-book).
